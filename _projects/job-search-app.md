<p>The job-search-app is a command-line tool that takes a resume, a job title, and a few filtering parameters, and then outputs a list of job ads ranked by qualification of the supplied resume. The app uses Selenium to scrape the job ads from popular job boards. The Beautiful Soup library in Python is used to parse the files and determine the match.</p>
