<p>I am a data analyst interested in using statistics and computational methods to drive business decisions and improve performance. I specialize in automated services and predictive analytics. My main areas of focus are finance, security, and marketing.</p>

<p>Outside of the professional landscape, I am interested in combating large-scale impending issues such as climate change, food scarcity, and resource depletion. I also want to help improve education for underserved groups and expand the scope of mental and behavioral health resources.</p>
